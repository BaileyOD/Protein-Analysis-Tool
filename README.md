# Protein-Analysis-Tool
Python Script that analyses protein sequences (or translates DNA sequences into protein sequences) and visualises amino acid composition. Ideal for genomics and proteomic projects

# Features
Automatically detects DNA or protein sequences from a FASTA file

Translates DNA sequences to protein (stops at first stop codon)

Computes protein statistics:

Sequence length

Molecular weight (Da)

Isoelectric point (pI)

Amino acid composition (%)

Generates histogram plots of amino acid composition

Saves plots automatically to a /plots folder

# Requirements
```bash
pip install biopython matplotlib
```
